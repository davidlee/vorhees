Vorhees is a simple JSON client and accompanying rspec matcher. 

It's designed to aid the authors of simple JSON socket protocols & servers.

It's opinionated, in that it expects you'll use a key (the default is
'command') to differentiate types of message; it assumes that the commands are
uppercase; and that you're using rspec -- other than that it should be
reasonably universal.

As an example, the following will assert that a message was received within 2
seconds, with the values {"command":"HELLO", "recipient":"world"}. Additional
values are allowed (i.e., a "body" field wouldn't cause the spec to fail):

@client = Vorhees::Client.new(:host => 'localhost', :port => 1234)
@client.should receive(:hello, :timeout => 2.0) { |msg| 
  msg['recipient].should == 'world'
}

If you're interested, let me know and I'll try to add spec coverage for some
of the other (currently undocumented) features.
